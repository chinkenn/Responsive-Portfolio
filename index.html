            <p>I'm currently an operation supervisor at an industrial supply distribution company. My background is in mechanical and industrial engineering with a focus in operations management. In my role now, I'm responsible for managing the performance of 15 team members in our sales organization, running an efficient operation, and working on process improvement projects. The latest project I've been working on is to highlight the friction in our ordering process for our made-to-order products and to make recommendations for improvement.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy travelling with my most recent trip being a week-long vacation in London. While in London, I took in the sights and experienced the immense history and culture of the city. My favorite spots were Westminster Abbey and the British Library and on top of that, I took in a play at the renovated Shakespeare Globe Theater and enjoyed the multicultural cuisines that London has to offer.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy watching sports in my spare time. Most of my Saturday afternoons in the fall are spent cheering on the Michigan Wolverines. I also wake up early on weekend mornings to support Arsenal FC.</p>
